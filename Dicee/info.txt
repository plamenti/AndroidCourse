To change the theme:
Open values/styles.xml (C:\AndroidStudioProjects\AndroidCourse\Dicee\app\src\main\res\values\styles.xml) and above the window should appear label "Edit all themes in the project in the theme editor" and on the left side of the label should appear link to "Open editor" - Click on the link
or
Select Tools -> Theme Editor
From Theme Parent select the theme or select All Themes and select the theme


To add new launcher icons:
Right click on the res directory -> New -> Image Asset
For Icon type select Launcher Icons
From Source Asset select Asset type Image
Add the path to the assets - should be .png with resolution e..g. 512x512. The Android studio will create from it files in all needed resolutions.

If we change the name of the launcher icon, we should navigate to AndroidManifest.xml and change android:icon="@mipmap/new_launcher_icon_name"

All graphical resources should be put in res folder.
