An Android app consists of series of files.
The layout file is under layout directory and is responsible for arranging the screen (in this project activity_main.xml).
The strings.xml is under the values directory and it should contain all the text that is used by the app.
The styles.xml is also under the values directory and here we decide on what style, what theme to base our app on.
The component tree is in Design view under Palette and lists all the elements on the screen.
We can change the attributes/properties of these elements in Attributes panel.
Under res folder is drawable folder that should contain the graphics for the app.
To add an image to the activity_main xml scroll down in the Palette to Image View. The Image View is like an empty picture frame in which we can hang an image - just drag and drop the Image View somewhere in the layout. Pop-up Resources should appear and we can choose the resource for the image that we want to add to the view - select Project -> the source file of the image. In Attributes panel under ImageView section in srcCompat field should be appeared the source of the image.
To list all attributes for activity_main layout click View all attributes in Attributes panel. To change the background color of the main view select background property -> click the dots -> from Resources pop-up select Color ->  Project -> some color.
To change some element property find it in Attributes and change it.
To add launcher icon in the app - in mipmap folder are default icons. Smallest is hdpi, largest - xxxhdpi. Each one is appropriate for different devices and resolutions.
In order to tell the app to use the new icons in AndroidManifest.xml file chanage teh value of the android:icon property to new launcher icons.
AndroidManifest.xml file is the BOSS file - all info about the map is in it.
