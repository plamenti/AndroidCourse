An Android app consists of series of files.
The layout file is under layout directory and is responsible for arranging the screen (in this project activity_main.xml).
The strings.xml is under the values directory and it should contain all the text that is used by the app.
The styles.xml is also under the values directory and here we decide on what style, what theme to base our app on.
The component tree is in Design view under Palette and lists all the elements on the screen.
We can change teh attributes/properties of these elements in Attributes panel.
